    The behaviours control what is discovered from the Bitbucket repository. The behaviours are grouped into a number
    of categories:
    <dl>
        <dt>Within repository</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours determine what gets discovered. <strong>If you do not configure at least one discovery
            behaviour then nothing will be found!</strong></dd>
        <dt>General</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours affect the configuration of each discovered branch / pull request.
        </dd>
        <dt>Git</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours affect the configuration of each discovered branch / pull request
            and are specific to Git semantics.
        </dd>
    </dl>

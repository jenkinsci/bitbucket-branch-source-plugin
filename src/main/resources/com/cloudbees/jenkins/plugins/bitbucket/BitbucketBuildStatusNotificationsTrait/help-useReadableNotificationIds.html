    By enabling this feature, the key used to send a build notification status is not hashed. This allow filtering
    in Bitbucket Data Center (only) for <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/checks-for-merging-pull-requests-776640039.html">
    Required builds merge check</a>.
    <p>
    Please note that changing this value will cause all build-time commits (e.g. pull requests) to have a duplicate build notification status due to the key change.

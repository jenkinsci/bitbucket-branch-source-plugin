    Prevents a prematurely successful state of not fully tested PRs.
    <br/>
    <strong>"Exclude branches that are also filed as PRs"</strong> strategy implies that branch and PR builds
    do share the same key while publishing the build status to Bitbucket, thus can overwrite statuses of each other.
    Usually, it happens when the branch build finishes in the middle of a running PR build
    so Bitbucket has been already notified about the branch status and
    (in case this status was a success) we can merge the PR until the PR build is completed.

    <br/>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> this option is only applicable when <strong>"Exclude branches that are also filed as PRs"</strong> strategy in multibranch configuration is used.

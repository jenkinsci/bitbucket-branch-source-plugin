        Comma separated list of user ids in bitbucket to ignore commits from for triggering the webhook.
    </p>
    <p>
        committerToIgnore is used exclusively by the "Post Webhooks for Bitbucket" plugin to prevent a server notification
        from being sent to the Jenkins instance to avoid triggering builds when commits are made by certain users.

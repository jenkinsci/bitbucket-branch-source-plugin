        If you're using a self-signed certificate and want to disable certificate verification, select Skip certificate
        verification.

    <p>
        <b>Note</b> We recommend that you don't disable certificate verification because self-signed certificates are
        inherently not secure. Read the next section for more information about why you would or wouldn't use
        self-signed
        certificates.
